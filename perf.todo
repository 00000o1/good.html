- each component is invisible until it is loaded. Works with lazy as long as we don't pipleine the fetch.
- moving becomesTrue to a subscription push rather than polling model. Improves perf.
- pipeLining fetches (max concurrent requests) does not improve load performance. I want each component to load separately, when it's ready, but this does not happen. I think because the work is CPU and DOM bound. So holding back network requests doesn't work. I need to split and batch or pipeline the DOM rendering.
