# *BANG!* *A custom element library for the new age.*

### regular tags

```js
<custom-el>
  <my-humps></my-humps>
</custom-el>
```

### self-closing void custom element tags (***with a bang!**)

```js
<div>
  <!custom-el2 />
</div>
```

All the above are ***valid*** HTML and converted by our mutation-aware parser into valid custom elements.

You can even omit the closing slash `/>`, so `<!custom-el2>` is also a valid void self-closing tag; just don't omit the bang (!) because that's how we signal it's a self-closing void tag.

------

***The problem of self-closing tags in HTML has been solved. Hoo-ray!***
