# *BANG!*

A custom element library for the new age.

### regular tags

```html
<custom-el>
  <my-humps></my-humps>
</custom-el>
```

### self-close tags

```html
<!custom-el> or
<!custom-el2 /> or
<! custom-el3 /> or
<! custom-el4 > or
<! custom-el5/> or
<! custom-el6>
```

All the above are VALID HTML and converted by our mutation-aware parser into valid custom elements, the only thing that doesn't work is *syntax highlighting* for this `.bang!html`.

------

***The problem of self-closing tags in HTML has been solved. Hoo-ray!***
