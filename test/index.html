  <h1 onclick=Confirm>Hello there</h1>
</test-component>
<!test-void onclick=Confirm>
<test-profile state=SomeObject></test-profile>
<p>
  What does SomeObject refer to?
  A property on the test-profile class?
  A global object?
  An object in the scope that contains all state?
  A key on a global state object?
  A property of a containing component?
  --
  I think a global key value store for state is a good idea.
  And we can also pass a property from a containing component as the state
  for a descendent component, and this object value will be placed into the global
  key value store automatically and have a key issued for it, and that object 
  will be replaced by its key, so that the descendent component can look up the object.
